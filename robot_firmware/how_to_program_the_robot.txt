The procedure below shows how to program the robot 'brain'. The brain is the 'WEMOS D1 Mini' part.
Normally, the D1 can be programmed while the display-module is attached.

The instructions below assume a Linux machine is used. Howere, all those steps can be done on Windows as well.
If Windows are used, the main change is the name of the serial.
 
Install dependencies:

   pip install adafruit-ampy 
   sudo apt install esptool python3-serial python-serial

Steps:

1) Connect the D1 to a PC running Linux, using a normal 'Android' USB cable

2) Using terminal, run 'ls /dev/ttyUSB'. This should show /dev/ttyUSB0
   If only /dev/ttyUSB2 exists, you should change 'burn' to reflect this
   If the 'ls' command above does not show anything, the D1 was not recognized.
   This must be resolved before continuing.

OPTIONAL: you can bring the latest firmware build from
     http://micropython.org/download#esp8266
     If you bring such a file, you need to modify the 2nd line of 'burn'

3) Program the D1 w/microPython: Simply run './burn'
   Note: 'burn' depends on the 'serial' Python module.

4) Sanity check: disconnect the D1 from the USB and plug back.
   When you re-connect the D1, one of the LEDs should blink twice.
   If the LED does not blink, or blink all the time, try to run 'burn' again
   Note: Detailed instructions of programming the D1 and troubleshooting can be found at:
   http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html#deploying-the-firmware

5) Burn the additional files:
   Run './send_all_files'


Testing:

1) Connect to the D1: 
   The D1 looks like serial port at /dev/ttyUSB0 (rarly: /dev/ttyUSB1)
   You can connect to it using: putty, minicom, screen, or any other 'terminal emulation' sofware

   Once you are connected, hit "Enter" few times, and you should get the ">>>" REPL prompt.
   If you do not get the prompt, try unplugin/pluging from USB. If this fails, try 'burn' again.
   There is no point to continue w/o the REPL prompt.


 
Steps that are repeated each time the D1 is used:
1) Connect to the PC/laptop to the WiFi access-point created by the D1:
   Look at the available WiFi networks for a network called "MicroPython-xxxxxx" (the 'xxxxxx' part is different for each D1)
   Connect to this network.
   Note: This will probably disconnect you from the Internet. 

2) Connect to the D1 using WebREPL:
   If needed, download the webrepl files from  https://github.com/micropython/webrepl.
   Open the file "open webrepl.html in a browser. 
   You should get a prompt to choose password (first time) or login.
   After login, you should get the ">>>" prompt. You are also able to upload and download files.
   There are more details at: https://github.com/micropython/webrepl


3    Using WebREPL, import the 'robot' module. This will define 4 outputs:
    pwmRight, dirRight, pwmLeft, dirLeft
    Each of those can be set to high or low, for example:
    pwmRight.low() or pwmLeft.high()
