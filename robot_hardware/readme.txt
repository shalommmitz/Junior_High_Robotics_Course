Tips for building the robot:

1) Have a look at the picture of the built robot and plan the order.
   It is good to start with parts at the center, which are not high (because high parts make access to other parts hard).

2) The "brain" (I.e., the Wemos D1 Mini part) should be soldered with female/male, so it can be inserted into the PCB AND receive the display.
It is critical that all those parts are soldered exactly parpndicular:
    - the 'socket' that connect the brain to the PCB
    - the male/female socket that is soldered to the brain
    - The 'male' part that is soldered to the display.
